QSvn is a Qt based Subversion client.

It is developed as a cross platform application that runs on all Qt supported
operating systems. At the moment these are UNIX/Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
QSvn is tested at Linux and at Windows.

Please remember that you need to install the Subversion. You can download it
for free at http://http://subversion.tigris.org/
In any later version of QSvn we will use Subversion libraries directly so you
don't need to install Subversion client separately.

More Information about QSvn you find at our website http://qsvn.berlios.de
