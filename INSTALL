Compile & Install under UNIX
============================

For compilation under UNIX you need the following software packages:

- Qt4
- cmake 2.4.0 or greater
- subversion libraries and headers

Debian:

Prepare system for build with debugger and cmake:
  apt-get install build-essential gdb cmake

Install Qt4
  apt-get install libqt4-core libqt4-debug libqt4-dev libqt4-gui libqt4-qt3support libqt4-sql qt4-designer qt4-dev-tools qt4-doc qt4-qtconfig 

Install Subversion and Libraries
  apt-get install subversion libsvn-dev libapr1 libapr1-dbg libapr1-dev libaprutil1 libaprutil1-dbg libaprutil1-dev

It is recommended to use ccache for increase continuous builds
  apt-get install ccache
  add "export PATH="/usr/lib/ccache:$PATH" to ~/.bashrc

If you like to develop under KDE i recommended to
  apt-get install kdevelop kde-devel-extras

Compile for Release
-------------------

  mkdir build
  cd build
  ../scripts/release.sh
When you would install qsvn call
  sudo make install

Compile for Developing
----------------------

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug" ../src
  make

If you prefer to use KDevelop as an IDE type:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -G "KDevelop3" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug" ../src



Compile & Install under Windows
===============================

For compilation under Windows you need the following software packages:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2008
  I recommended the free available Express Edition from
    http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/
  After installation of Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 you can open a Visual Studio 
  2008 Command prompt to compile source code with the Visual C++ Compiler.
- Subversion & Development Libraries
  Download the latest Subversion Release and the corresponding Development Libraries.
  Install Subversion in your Program Folder.
  Unpack the development libraries into the Subversion installation folder.
    http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91
  In addition to this you need the libintl development libraries and headers
    http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=2627
  and the Berkley DB libraries and headers 
    http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=688
- CMake 2.4.4 or greater
    http://www.cmake.org
- Qt4 compiled for use with MSVC++
  Download the latest Qt4 Source Package for Windows.
    http://www.trolltech.com
  After the Qt is compiled you must add the Qt-bin-directory to your PATH variable. 
  CMake is looking for Qt libraries in PATH-directories also.
- InnoSetup with QuickStart Pack (http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
  In order to build the installation you need to install Install InnoSetup 
  and the Preprocessor. After you had install InnoSetup, add it to your PATH.


Compile for Release
-------------------

  mkdir release
  cd release
  c:\path\to\qsvn\source\scripts\release.cmd -D SUBVERSION_INSTALL_PATH=c:\path\to\svn


Compile for Development
-----------------------

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug" ..\src
  nmake

If you prefer the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition as your IDE type in:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" ..\src

Build Installation
------------------

For build the QSvn Installer for Windows follow the instruction found in
  src\setup\README
