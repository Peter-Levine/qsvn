To compile QSvn you need Qt4. If your Distribution have Qt4 Packages please install it. 
Otherwise follow the Setup Development Environment instructions.

1. Setup Development Environment
================================

1.1. Install Qt4
----------------

- download Qt 4.0.1 tarball from Qt X11 Downloadpage 
- untar it into a temporary directory. 
- cd into these directory. 
- configure Qt4 
- build Qt4 
- login as root 
- install Qt4 

cd /tmp
tar xvzf qt-x11-opensource-src-4.0.1.tar.gz
cd qt-x11-opensource-src-4.0.1
./configure
make
su
make install

1.2. Setup environment
----------------------

- add /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.0.1/bin/ to your PATH variable 
- unset QTDIR if you have installed Qt3 
- for daily usage you can create a set_env script and source it before you work with Qt4 

export QTDIR=
export PATH=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.0.1/bin/:$PATH
PS1="[qt4]$PS1"

1.3. Install needed Packages
----------------------------

To compile QSvn you need the header files for apr and subversion. 
On linux distributions you usually install the development packages for apr and subversion.


2. Compile QSvn
===============

2.1 Prepare
-----------

Before you compile QSvn please make sure, that the apr and subversion headers are installed in
  /usr/include/subversion-1
  /usr/include/apr-0
Otherwise adopt the directories in qsvn.pro to your setup.


2.2 Compile
-----------

- cd into qsvn source dir.
- run Qt4's qmake
- run make

cd /path/to/qsvn/source/
qmake qsvn.pro
make
