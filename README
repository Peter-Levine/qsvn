QSvn is a Qt based Subversion client.

It is developed as a cross platform application that runs on all Qt supported
operating systems. At the moment these are UNIX/Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
QSvn is tested at the moment for Linux and Windows.

Please remember that you need to install the Subversion client. You can download 
it for free at http://subversion.tigris.org/
In any later version of QSvn we will use Subversion libraries directly so you
don't need to install Subversion client separately.

The Windows version install a small Subversion client under the programmdirectory 
in the subfolder svn. This can use for QSvn at the moment. So it ist not necessary
to install Subversion separately on your system.

More Information about QSvn you will find at http://qsvn.berlios.de
