{"name":"QSvn","tagline":"GUI Subversion Client for Linux, Unix, Mac OS X and Windows","body":"### Welcome to QSvn\r\n\r\nQSvn is a GUI [Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org/) client for Linux, UNIX, Mac OS X and Windows. It is a real client not a GUI wrapper for the command line client from Subversion.\r\n\r\nQSvn uses a C++ Subversion wrapper developed by the [Kdesvn Project](http://kdesvn.alwins-world.de/). For cross plattform capability, QSvn uses the [Qt Framework](http://qt.digia.com/).\r\n\r\nThe latest version of QSvn is version 0.8.3, released on July 26, 2009.\r\n\r\n### Development\r\n\r\nThe development of QSvn is stopped. I have switched all my private repositories from Subversion to Git. So i haven't any interest in a Subversion client anymore.\r\n\r\nThe last commit is some years ago.\r\n\r\n### Open Source\r\n\r\nQSvn is completely Open Source. As i decided to finish the development in QSvn i searched a solution for hosting the project outside my own server. So here it is.\r\n\r\nIf you are a Developer, who loves Open Source, Subversion, Qt and QSvn or even one of them, feel free to fork the project and develop the next big version of QSvn.\r\n\r\nIf you habe any questions about this project, enter into contact with me.","google":"UA-7643639-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
